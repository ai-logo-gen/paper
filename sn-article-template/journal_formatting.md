Text Formatting

Manuscripts should be submitted in Word.

    Use a normal, plain font (e.g., 10-point Times Roman) for text.
    Use italics for emphasis.
    Use the automatic page numbering function to number the pages.
    Do not use field functions.
    Use tab stops or other commands for indents, not the space bar.
    Use the table function, not spreadsheets, to make tables.
    Use the equation editor or MathType for equations.
    Save your file in docx format (Word 2007 or higher) or doc format (older Word versions).

Manuscripts with mathematical content can also be submitted in LaTeX. We recommend using Springer Nature’s LaTeX template.
Headings

Please use the decimal system of headings with no more than three levels.
Abbreviations

Abbreviations should be defined at first mention and used consistently thereafter.

Tables

    All tables are to be numbered using Arabic numerals.
    Tables should always be cited in text in consecutive numerical order.
    For each table, please supply a table caption (title) explaining the components of the table.
    Identify any previously published material by giving the original source in the form of a reference at the end of the table caption.
    Footnotes to tables should be indicated by superscript lower-case letters (or asterisks for significance values and other statistical data) and included beneath the table body.

Figure Lettering

    To add lettering, it is best to use Helvetica or Arial (sans serif fonts).
    Keep lettering consistently sized throughout your final-sized artwork, usually about 2–3 mm (8–12 pt).
    Variance of type size within an illustration should be minimal, e.g., do not use 8-pt type on an axis and 20-pt type for the axis label.
    Avoid effects such as shading, outline letters, etc.
    Do not include titles or captions within your illustrations.

Figure Numbering

    All figures are to be numbered using Arabic numerals.
    Figures should always be cited in text in consecutive numerical order.
    Figure parts should be denoted by lowercase letters (a, b, c, etc.).
    If an appendix appears in your article and it contains one or more figures, continue the consecutive numbering of the main text. Do not number the appendix figures,"A1, A2, A3, etc." Figures in online appendices [Supplementary Information (SI)] should, however, be numbered separately.

Figure Captions

    Each figure should have a concise caption describing accurately what the figure depicts. Include the captions in the text file of the manuscript, not in the figure file.
    Figure captions begin with the term Fig. in bold type, followed by the figure number, also in bold type.
    No punctuation is to be included after the number, nor is any punctuation to be placed at the end of the caption.
    Identify all elements found in the figure in the figure caption; and use boxes, circles, etc., as coordinate points in graphs.
    Identify previously published material by giving the original source in the form of a reference citation at the end of the figure caption.

Figure Placement and Size

    Figures should be submitted within the body of the text. Only if the file size of the manuscript causes problems in uploading it, the large figures should be submitted separately from the text.
    When preparing your figures, size figures to fit in the column width.
    For large-sized journals the figures should be 84 mm (for double-column text areas), or 174 mm (for single-column text areas) wide and not higher than 234 mm.
    For small-sized journals, the figures should be 119 mm wide and not higher than 195 mm.

Title Page

Please make sure your title page contains the following information.

Title

The title should be concise and informative.

Author information

    The name(s) of the author(s)
    The affiliation(s) of the author(s), i.e. institution, (department), city, (state), country
    A clear indication and an active e-mail address of the corresponding author
    If available, the 16-digit ORCID of the author(s)

If address information is provided with the affiliation(s) it will also be published.

For authors that are (temporarily) unaffiliated we will only capture their city and country of residence, not their e-mail address unless specifically requested.


--------------------------

Abstract

Please provide an abstract of 150 to 250 words. The abstract should not contain any undefined abbreviations or unspecified references.

Please note: For some articles (particularly, systematic reviews and original research articles), 250 words may not be sufficient to provide all necessary information in the abstract. Therefore, the abstract length can be increased from the 250-word limit (to up to 450 words) if the topic dictates, and to allow full compliance with the relevant reporting guidelines.

Keywords

Please provide 4 to 6 keywords which can be used for indexing purposes.
